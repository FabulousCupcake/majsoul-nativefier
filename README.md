# Majsoul Nativefier
This repository contains [nativefier][1] configuration to wrap [Mahjong Soul][2] with Electron.

_**Disclaimer:** This repository and its contents are not affiliated, associated, or in any way officially connected with Mahjong Soul. All names, logos, images, and brands are property of their respective owners._

## Usage
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run nativefier
npm run build
```

## Configuring Fonts
The default-font-family override can be configured in [index.js][4]. It is set to `Comic Sans MS` by default.

A personal recommendation is [Cronos Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/cronos) which can be obtained free of cost from Adobe Fonts. It must be installed to your local system to be used.
